## Who am I?
I’m a mathematician, programmer, and data scientist based in New York City. I received my bachelors degree in mathematics at Temple University, with my undergraduate research in graph theory and abstract algebra using Python. Subsequently I attended General Assembly’s Data Science Immersive program where I became more versed in statistics and machine learning, in addition to many other things. I’m drawn to situations that allow me to use an analytical approach in conjunction with technical theory to solve real world problems.

## What else do I do?
In my free time I enjoy tabletop gaming, especially Magic: The Gathering due to its deep and interesting qualities. I also contribute to the open-source project XMage, a program for playing Magic digitally.
