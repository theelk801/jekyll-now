## Who am I?
My name’s Evan, I studied mathematics at Temple University where I did undergraduate research in graph theory and abstract algebra using Python. I also attended General Assembly’s Data Science Immersive program to become more versed in statistics and machine learning, in addition to many other things. I’m drawn to the kind of situations that let me apply my problem-solving skills.

## What else do I do?
In my free time I enjoy tabletop gaming, especially Magic: The Gathering due to its deep and interesting qualities. I also contribute to the open-source project XMage, a program for playing Magic digitally.
